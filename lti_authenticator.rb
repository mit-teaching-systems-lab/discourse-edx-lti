  # The UX we want here is that if this is the first time a learner has authenticated,
  # we'll create a new user record for them automatically (so they don't see the modal
  # for creating their own user).  A second-time learner should just be authenticated
  # and go right into Discourse.
  #
  # We've set `SiteSetting.invite_only?` to true in order to disable the "Sign up" flow
  # in Discourse.  So this code instantiates a new User record because otherwise the
  # standard flow will popup a dialog to let them change their username, and that would
  # fail to create a new user since `SiteSetting.invite_only?` is true.
